# World_Weather_Analysis
## Module 6 of Data Analytics bootcamp

### Overview

We have begun working on developing a vacation planning app, and our goal is to create an app that can take in information about preferred weather on a vacation trip and return all the places in our system that meet the preferred weather requirements. Once potential travel destinations are identified, the user will choose four cities close to each other in order to create a travel itinerary. Using Google Maps Directions API, our code will create a travel route between the four cities selected and create a map with markers.


### Software/Languages Used

For this project, I wrote the code in python using dependencies pandas, numpy, gmaps, Matplotlib.pyplot, and datetime. We also imported requests in order to call APIs from both Google Maps and Open Weather Map. The code was written and executed in Jupiter Notebook.
